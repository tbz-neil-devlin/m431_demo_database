## Tools needed
* **A git commandline editor**
  * To allow me to work on my PC and use git I dedided to use gig bash. "_Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience_" (“What is Git Bash?”)
* **Source Code control**
  * In order to manage my code and any artifacts that I would produce I needed a Source Code Control System. As I already use gitlab I decided to use this, what is gitlab: _"GitLab is an open source code repository and collaborative software development platform for large DevOps and DevSecOps projects. GitLab is free for individuals._" (“What is GitLab? | Definition from TechTarget”)
* **GitHub CLI**
  * Is a command line interface to GitHub, wasn't that usefull
* **A tool to make screenshots**
  * To capture schreenshots I decided to use Microsoft's Snipping tool
* **An editor**
  * For editing files I decided to use Notepad++. "_Notepad++ is a free (as in “free speech” and also as in “free beer”) source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GNU General Public License._" (“What is Notepad++”)
* **A tool to make flowcharts**
  * I needed a tool to create flowcharts, I decided to use drawio.
