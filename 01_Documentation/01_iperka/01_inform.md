# How I gathered the information needed for this assignment

## How did I get the idea
* The idea was to write a C program that connects to a SQL database. What I then needed was a use case where such a function could be usefull. My thoughts turned to a list of words that could be used in a game such as "hangman".

## What type of informtion did I need
* Dates
  * I needed to know what dates & deadlines were important for my assignment
* Deliverables
  * I needed to know what exactly the product should be & how can I deliver it to the teacher
  * I needed to know what subjects I needed to write about, the format of the documentation & where it should be stored 
* Knowledge
  * As I would have to read up on C & sqllite I would need some sort of tutorial
* Tools needed
  * I needed to find out what tools I would need to use (or download)

## Gathering information
### Requirements for the Product
* There are 2 sources for requirements, one is the teacher (customer) and the other is from myself
* Thinking about how I wanted my app to behave I wrote a list of requirements, I then:
  * related them to either the app or the database 
  * wrote down from whom these requirements were coming from  
![requirements][product]

### Requirements for the Documentation
* There was a long list of requirements concerning documentation, these would have to be considered in the implementation
![requirements][documentation]


## What type of informtion did I gather
* Dates
  * The submission date was 30 of January given by the teacher, therefore all work & checks must be finished by this date
* Deliverables
  * An app that creates a database and an app that reads from that database
  * A set documentats that describe how I applied the IPERKA method to this assignment 
* Tutorial needed
  * I list of tutorials that I found usefull
* Tools needed
  * Using the requirements lists & some research I identified a list of tools

## Goals
* Learn how to create a Gantt chart in GitHub
  * Measrured by the presence of a chart that relates to the assignment
  * Acheivaable & realsitic
  * Timely: the chart must used throughout the assignment
* Refresh my C skills
  * Measrured by writing the code that conforms to my requirements for the app
  * Acheivaable & realsitic
  * Timely: the code must be complete by the deadline

## Tools needed
* **A git commandline editor**
  * To allow me to work on my PC and use git I dedided to use gig bash. "_Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience_" (“What is Git Bash?”)
* **Source Code control**
  * In order to manage my code and any artifacts that I would produce I needed a Source Code Control System. As I already use gitlab I decided to use this, what is gitlab: _"GitLab is an open source code repository and collaborative software development platform for large DevOps and DevSecOps projects. GitLab is free for individuals._" (“What is GitLab? | Definition from TechTarget”)
* **GitHub CLI**
  * Is a command line interface to GitHub, wasn't that usefull
* **A tool to make screenshots**
  * To capture schreenshots I decided to use Microsoft's Snipping tool
* **An editor**
  * For editing files I decided to use Notepad++. "_Notepad++ is a free (as in “free speech” and also as in “free beer”) source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GNU General Public License._" (“What is Notepad++”)
* **A tool to make flowcharts**
  * I needed a tool to create flowcharts, I decided to use drawio.
* **A C compiler**
  * I would need a compiler, this is not installed on MS Windows by default
* **A Database browser**
  * To be able to view that contacts of databases I would need some sort of database browser
