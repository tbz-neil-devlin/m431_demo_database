# How I made decisions for this assignment
* Being solo on this assignment meant that decision making was straightforward
* However, it is important to document them as sometimes you need to remind yourself of your own rules

## Decision log
* **Decision:** Split the create word-picker task into individual functions
  * **Reason:** It is easy to control the progress
  * **Date:** 31.12.2023  
* **Decision:** Capture all references in a documents
  * **Reason:** By doing so I also capture the date and save a lot of time later
  * **Date:** 10.11.2023  
* **Decision:** Start the documentation as soon as possible & write as I go along
  * **Reason:** I write the documentation when it is freash in my head & can correct it later
  * **Date:** 10.11.2023  
* **Decision:** Install codeblocks & not gcc directly
  * **Reason:** It is possible to install the C compiler directly, but it seems quite messy, an easier approace to is install codeblocks with the minimum freatues 
  * **Date:** 23.11.2023  
* **Decision:** Write a second program that creates a database
  * **Reason:** It would give the end user the possibilit to use their own word-lists 
  * **Date:** 16.11.2023  
  
## Decisionmatrix
* One of the main decision I had to make was whether to use a native C compiler or one that comes in an IDE. My main motivation was simplicity & system resources (or lack of). The matrix below shows how I made this decision.
