Towards
the
end
of
the
vacation,
I
was
sitting
in
the
porter's
chair
when
a
man
the
double
of
Billy
Bunter,
mounted
the
steps
and
came
in.
A
small
fat
man
with
heavy
gleaming
glasses,
large
tummy,
a
black
jacket,
black
waist-coat,
watch
chain
and
striped
trousers.
He
had
a
little
moustache.
He
walked
with
a
cocky,
confident
air.
'Good
day,
sir',
said
O'Keeffe
smartly,
touching
what
once
might
have
been
a
forelock.
'Ha,
O
ha,
how
are
yeh
today?'
Well
enough,
sir,
thank
you.
'Deed
yeh
are,
like
myself.'
He
had
a
very
pronounced
Dublin
accent
and
he
went
on
upstairs.
"Know
who
that
be,
sir?'
asked.
'Mr
Devlin,
he
'as
a
great
practice.
Great
man.
At
the
Bar
I
got
to
know
him
very
well,
but
I
was
warned
about
him
at
the
beginning.
He
displayed
the
utmost
friendliness
and
eagerness
to
help
any
new
barrister.
'Try
and
cut
your
teeth
on
this
little
easy
thing
before
the
Master,
it's
the
simplest
little
job
before
Judge
'Byrne',
he
would
say
to
some
unsuspecting
victim
and
hand
him
papers.
The
eager
young
man
would
hasten
into
court
to
find
that
the
papers
that
he
held
in
his
hand
contained
a
time
bomb
of
the
most
confounding
problems.
The
young
practitioner
was
usually
thrown
out
by
the
judge
and
would
come
red-faced
and
stumbling
in
a
dazed
condition
back
to
the
Library.
'How
did
you
get
on?
Ah,
sure
not
to
worry,
you'll
get
better
next
time.
But
John
really
never
wanted
to
hear
about
the
disaster.
At
that
time,
there
was
a
man
who
had
retired
from
the
legal
department
of
the
army.
His
name
was
Manus
Noonan
and
he
subsequently
became
a
District
Justice.
Whether
he
had
learned
anything
by
the
time
he
had
achieved
that
judicial
office
is
debatable,
but
he
certainly
knew
nothing
as
a
result
of
his
career
in
the
army.
He
sat
in
the
Library
looking
into
space.
Approaching
him
one
day,
John
said
to
him:
'It
would
be
a
very
good
experience
for
you,
Noonan,
and
something
for
you
to
be
able
to
sit
behind
the
best
man
in
the
whole
of
this
place,
indeed
in
the
whole
of
the
county,
north
and
south
and
indeed
in
London
and
everywhere,
to
sit
behind
him
for
half
an
hour
or
so
and
take
a
little
note
of
what
he's
saying
and
you'
d
learn
how
to
open
an
appeal
in
the
Supreme
Court.'
"Oh,
that
would
be
great,
said
the
other,
but
I
hope
wouldn't
have
to
do
anything,
would
I?'
'Deed
you
wouldn't,
'deed
you
wouldn't,
not
at
all,
not
at
all
You'd
hold
the
junior
brief
and
take
a
note
for
a
while,
until
I've
got
over
a
few
of
me
problems
here
around
the
Circuit
Court
before
that
awful
man,
and
I'd
get
back
to
you
and
off
you
could
go.'
