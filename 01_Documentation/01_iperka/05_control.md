# Control

# How I checked & controlled this assignment
## Highlevel steps
1. Review the product requirements
2. Design testcases to make sure each requirement is tested
3. Review the Documentation requirements

# Designing a tests
* Each requirement that I identified had to be tested, word-picker.c & create-word-database.c needed to be tested
* I using the requirements list I tried to identify a testcases that when executed would check as many of the requirements as possible in one go
* I identified three testcasea for word-picker.c
  * Testcase TC001: to test the main functions
  * Testcase TC002: test test error handling  
  * Testcase TC003: to test error handling when a worng file is pointed to
* I identified three testcasea for create-word-database.c
  * Testcase TC001: tests the handling of words that are too small ot big
  * Testcase TC002: test the handling of words that contain special characters  
  * Testcase TC003: ensures that all words are imported into the database
