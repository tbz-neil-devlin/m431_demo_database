# Planning

# How I planned this assignment
## Highlevel steps
1. Brainstom to identify milestones & tasks
2. Create a resource plan
3. Create a list of milestones
4. Create a task list

## Brainstorm
* I thought about the typical phases and decided to use them in the assignment
* On a long flight from London to San Francisco I made some notes

## Resource plan
Because my time is quite limited I made a plan of my availability from the start to the end date
* I defined a start and an end date for the assignment
* I defined 3 preiods when I can perform work, nameley morning, afternoon & evenings
* I marked out the periods when I planned to work on the assignment
* I then calculated how much time (hours) I would have to deliver the assignment* I calculated the number of available hours

## Using GitHub as a task list
* I decided to have my task list in github
* I also decided to use GitHub's "Project" function to manage my assignment
* In created a GitHum project called
* I defined 4 fields
  * **Start**: The date when a given task can start
  * **Due**: The date upon whihc that task should finish
  * **Estimated effort**: The number of hours the task will required
  * **Actual effort**: The number of hours that were actually needed

## Milestones
I laid out 6 simple milestones
* I defined a start and an end date for the assignment  
![Milestones][plan2]

## How I created the task list
* Identified as many generic tasks as I could
* I then entered the tasks into github (as issues), assigning them to the appropriate milestone
* I then viewed the issue list in github project
* In my github project I created a "Estimated effort field".
* For each task I tried to:
  * estimate how many hours I would need, and then entered that value
  *	Using the resource plan I defined a date when it could start
  * I then gave it a due date
* I then calculated the total number of hours required and made sure it was below

## Creating a Gantt chart
* Using GitHub's project feature, I was able to create a Gantt chart  
![Tasklist][plan6]

## Managing the task list
* I was able to filter tasks (for example by date)
* I updated the status & dates as required
* In some cases I was able to start a task before schedule. I such cases i changed the start & due date as appropriate
* To try and keep track of my time spent I entered the time into the field **Actual Effort**
* As new tasks were identified these were also added to the list
