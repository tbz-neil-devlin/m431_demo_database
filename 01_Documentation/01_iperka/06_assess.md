# Assessment

## What went well
* Naming convention: The assignment produced over 200 files, having defined & stuck to a naming convention meant that I could find & identify files quickly
* Task list: The task list very useful & guided me throughout the assignment

## What could be improved
* Touchpad: Caused numerous errors while editing files. In future I will try using a normal keyboard 
* Code review: Even though the code worked, it should have been done earlier

## Were the goals achieved
* Gantt Chart: 
  * What was good is the fact that all issues/tasks in github were on the Gantt Chart. However, it is not a project management tool as it lacked a lot of functionality and in particular tools for calculating time spent etc
* Refresh my C skills: 
  * Yes this was achieved and I now want to refine these skills

## Evaluate the plan
* From my resource plan I had available hours: 72
* From my estimation of the task list I required hours: 80
* Personal goal: 40 hours
* Actual: 49 hours
* Conclusion: I should not have used all the available hours, as this left no buffer in case things went wrong. I was fortunate insofar as me estimations were very generous.
